### Description
I decided it was time to write a new website, and doing it in ReScript seemed like an exciting challenge.

### Tools used
- ReScript
- GraphQL (via ReScript Apollo)
- Emotion (via ReScript binding)
- Three.js
- DatoCMS (content delivery)

The only small pain was getting GraphQL set up, but Apollo via ReScript is pretty powerful and very easy to use, + fully typed which has already saved me a lot of time.
